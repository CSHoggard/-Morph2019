## Practical Two (Hoggard et al. 2019)

This is a modified R script from The Application of Elliptic Fourier Analysis in Understanding Biface Shape and Symmetry Through the British Acheulean in the *Journal of Palaeolithic Archaeology* (https://doi.org/10.1007/s41982-019-00024-6). Three files are required for this practical: 1) the script (**practical_two.r**), 2) the outline data created in the TpsSuite (**practical_two.tps**), and 3) the metadata in .csv format (**practical_two.csv**).

For any queries please contact C.S.Hoggard@soton.ac.uk
